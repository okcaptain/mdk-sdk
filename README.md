[Nightly Build SDK](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mdk-sdk/files/nightly/)

Install via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/mdk) in Visual Studio for both Windows desktop and UWP

[Changelog](https://github.com/wang-bin/mdk-sdk/blob/master/Changelog.md)

## Features
- Simple and powerful API set
- Cross platform: Windows, UWP, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, Raspberry Pi
- Hardware accelerated decoding and 0-copy GPU rendering for all platforms
- OpenGL, D3D11 and Metal rendering w/ or w/o user provided context
- Integrated with any gui toolkits or apps via OpenGL, D3D11 and Metal (OBS, Qt, SDL, glfw, SFML etc.) easily
- Seamless/Gapless media and bitrate switch for any media
- User configurable FFmpeg libraries at runtime
- HDR rendering in GPU
- Optimized Continuous seeking. As fast as mpv, but much lower cpu, memory and gpu load. Suitable for timeline preview


## FFmpeg Runtime
See https://github.com/wang-bin/mdk-sdk/wiki/FFmpeg-Runtime

## [API Levels](https://github.com/wang-bin/mdk-sdk/wiki/%E9%80%9A%E7%94%A8ABI%E7%9A%84CPP%E5%BA%93API%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1)
- ABI level APIs(not public): the implementation, in abi namespace. depends on c++ abi. build and runtime abi must be matched.
- C APIs: No C++ ABI restriction.
- C++ APIs: a header only thin wrapper for C APIs. No C++ ABI restriction. No user code change to switch between ABI level APIs and C++ APIs.

## How to Use

### CMake
```
	include(mdk-sdk-dir/lib/cmake/FindMDK.cmake)
	target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE mdk)
```
